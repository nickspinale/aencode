# aencode
A small Bencode library built on [attoparsec](https://github.com/bos/attoparsec) and [lens](https://github.com/ekmett/lens).

Inspired by (but much lamer than) [aeson](https://github.com/bos/aeson) (specifically the From/ToJSON classes).  
BValue type identical to that of [AttoBencode](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/AttoBencode).
